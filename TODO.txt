BUGS:
=================================
    - Check saving code for fab. table (crafting grid). [TEMP FIXED]
    - Fix energy cell gui input.   
    - *Fix energy cell not saving power*  
    - Fix te's not being 'active' when processing.

TODO:
=================================
    - Add fuel registry for nuclear stuff.
    - Implement fuel registry to 'run' off this fuel.
    - Add reactor chamber wall?
    - Add rector core.
    - Implement new rendering code for energy cell.
    - Make energy cell tiers unique (modify textures somehow).
    - Add saving of IO sides for energy cell(s).
    - Verify te's aren't pulling too much power from generators (especially with solar arrays)

IDEAS:
=================================    
    - Increase Titanium ore gen by * 2 atleast. 
    - Check and adjust crafting recipe weirdness 
    - Make energy pipes more clearly tiered? 
    - Add transfer rate info for all te's
    - Add 'compact solars'?
