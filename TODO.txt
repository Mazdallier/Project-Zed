BUGS:
=================================
    - Nuclear stuffs not showing generation rate in gui

TODO:
=================================
    - Add fuel registry for nuclear stuff. (kinda)
    - Make energy cell tiers unique (modify textures somehow).
    - Add implemented sounds to machines.
    - Add NEI support for crafting machine related recipes.
    - Implement fusion reactor logic.
    - Make tiered solar arrays have tiered max storages.
    - For tanks, add proper fluid handler
    - Add proper custom texture renderer for fluid tanks (see energy cell rendering techniques for more info).

IDEAS:
=================================    
    - Increase Titanium ore gen by * 2 at least. 
    - Make energy pipes more clearly tiered? 
    - Add fluid net similar to energy net?
    - Add fluid and item pipes?
